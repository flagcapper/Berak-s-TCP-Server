
this is a fork of https://github.com/McLeopold/TCPServer ,	hacked to play the Antsgame.

it's unofficial, and i bet it always will be,
since the only thing from the official repo used is ants.py.

skipping the sandboxes and engine.py might have introduced additional bugs.
also, its using trueskill.py for rankings, to stay pure python.
	(you already figured, you'd need python for this ?)


start it by (editing and) running main.py

current ports are:
	web_port = 2080
	tcp_port = 2081
	
	remember to adjust your firewall.
